## Finding Files ( Find and locate )
########################################

For ubuntu => sudo apt install plocate
# after install update database
sudo updatedb
sudo mandb	=>	update index database caches

# finding file by name
locate filename # => filename is expanded to *filename*
locate -i filename # => the filename is case insensitive
locate -b '\filename' # => finding by exact name

# Find command path
which <command>		=> 	which locate
which -a <command>		

# Disadvantage of locate command is this command not search files in real time
if we delete file and we use locate command, then also locate command will search 
that file so everytime we need to update the database for use of locate

## FIND ##
find PATH OPTIONS
 
# Example: find ~ -type f -size +1M # => finding all files in ~ bigger than 1 MB
 
## Options:
# -type f (regular file), d (directory), l (symbolik link), s (socket), p (FIFO)
# -name filename
# -iname filename # => case-insensitive
# -size n, +n, -n
# -perm permissions
# -links n, +n, -n
# -atime n, -mtime n, ctime n
# -user owner
# -group group_owner

# sudo find /etc -type f -mtime 0 -exec cp {} /home/backup \;
above command find and copies file where modified in last 24 hours into the /home/backup
