# Hard Link and Soft Link
##################################
#
# Hard link points to the inode number
A hard link acts as a copy (mirrored) of the selected file. It accesses the data available in the original file.
If the earlier selected file is deleted, the hard link to the file will still contain the data of that file.
@ You can not create hard link for directory
@ You can not create hard link to a file mounted on a different file system

# Soft link points to the file name
A soft link (also known as Symbolic link) acts as a pointer or a reference to the file name. It does not access the data available 
in the original file. If the earlier file is deleted, the soft link will be pointing to a file that does not exist anymore.

For see inode number use below command
ls -i <filename>
stat <filename>

ln <file1> <File2> 	=>	create hard link
ln -s <file1> <file2>	=> create soft link
